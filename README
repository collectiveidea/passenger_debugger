passenger_debugger===============
Restart passenger in debug mode

== INSTALL:
  $ gem install redinger-passenger_debugger -s http://gems.github.com
  
In development.rb add:

    config.gem 'passenger_debugger'

In your Rakefile add:

    begin
      require 'passenger_debugger/tasks'
    rescue LoadError
      STDERR.puts "Install passenger_debugger to enable debugging"
    end

Add the following lines to your ~/.rdebugrc

    set autoeval
    set autolist
    set autoreload

== USAGE:
  # Restart passenger in debug
  rake passenger:debug

  # Start loading a web page
  # Connect to the remote process
  rdebug -c
  
  # Once you exit the debugger, you'll need to restart in debug mode to reconnect
 
== NOTES:
  If you need to exit out of debug mode in a hurry, just remove the tmp/debug.txt file
