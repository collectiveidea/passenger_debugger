passenger_debugger===============
Restart passenger in debug mode

== INSTALL:

$ gem install passenger_debugger
  
In development.rb add:

    config.gem 'passenger_debugger'

In your Rakefile add:

    begin
      require 'passenger_debugger/tasks'
    rescue LoadError
      STDERR.puts "Install passenger_debugger to enable debugging"
    end

Add the following lines to your ~/.rdebugrc

    set autoeval
    set autolist
    set autoreload

== USAGE:
Use the rake task to enter debug mode

    $ rake passenger:debug

The rake task will pause to wait for you to refresh your browser. After refreshing, press enter to enter the debugger.
 
== NOTES:
  If you need to exit out of debug mode in a hurry, just remove the tmp/debug.txt file
